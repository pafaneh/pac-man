# Traveling PacMan Assignment
Pac Man Assignment with M.I.T x/Pro

## Project Details

In this assignment we had started code already written for us, and our task was to make enable the right and left movements.  Plus we had to set the interval timing of the animation as well.

## Installation

The only requirement is to download all files to your computer and open up the index.html file.  The animation will automatically start.  If you would like to modify the speed of the PacMan graphic you can adjust the interval speed from 200 to any number less or higher than that.

## Usage

The usage of this project is for us to gain practice on how we can control animation with Javascript, and how to contain the animation to a contained area within the viewers viewport.

## Support 

To discuss this project in detail please reach out to me at pamela.afaneh@gmail.com.  It was a fun assignment and I can't wait until I can code all of these types of projects from scratch.
